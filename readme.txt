In order to build and run my software, first you need to compile it. 

To compile it on a unix system, navigate to the folder where you unzipped to, and run: javac -cp "lib/*" -d ./bin ./src/*.java

Once this is complete, you can play the game by running: java -cp ./bin/ GameOfLife

In order to run the jUnit tests, simply run: java -cp ./lib/junit-4.8.jar:./bin org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CellTest BoardTest
